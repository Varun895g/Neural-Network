 Data Preprocessing
 # Data normalization and splitting
 data = np.array(data)
 np.random.shuffle(data)  # Randomize dataset
 # Split into validation and training sets
 data_val = data[0:1000].T    
# First 1000 for validation
 data_train = data[1000:m].T  # Remaining for training
 # Normalize pixel values to [0, 1]
 X_train = X_train / 255.
 X_val = X_val / 255.
 Neural Network Components
 1. Parameter Initialization
 Weights: Random initialization with range 0.5, 0.5
 Biases: Random initialization with range 0.5, 0.5
 2. Forward Propagation
 def forward_prop(W1, b1, W2, b2, X):
 Z1 = W1.dot(X) + b1      
A1 = ReLU(Z1)            
Z2 = W2.dot(A1) + b2     
A2 = softmax(Z2)         
# Linear transformation
 # ReLU activation
 # Linear transformation
 # Softmax activation
   return Z1, A1, Z2, A2
 # Backward Propagation
 # Implements gradient computation using chain rule:
  Computes gradients for weights and biases
 # Uses one-hot encoding for target labels
 # Applies ReLU derivative for hidden layer gradients
 # Parameter Updates
 Uses gradient descent with learning rate α = 0.10
 W1 = W1 - alpha * dW1
 b1 = b1 - alpha * db1
 W2 = W2 - alpha * dW2  
b2 = b2 - alpha * db2

# Performance Evaluation
 The model tracks training accuracy throughout the process and evaluates performance on the
 validation set. Key metrics include:
 Training Accuracy: Monitored during training process
 Validation Accuracy: Final performance metric on unseen data
 Prediction Visualization: Individual digit predictions with confidence
# Sample Predictions
 The implementation includes a testing function that:
 Displays the original handwritten digit image
 Shows the model's prediction
 Compares with the actual label
# Dependencies
 import os
 import json
 from zipfile import ZipFile
 from PIL import Image
 import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
 import numpy as np
 import pandas as pd
# This project demonstrates:
 f(x) = max(0, x)
 f'(x) = 1 if x > 0, else 0
 softmax(x_i) = exp(x_i) / Σ(exp(x_j))
 The model implicitly uses cross-entropy loss through the gradient computation in
 backpropagation.
